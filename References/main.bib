optabstract = {The Huntington's disease (HD) gene has been mapped in 4p16.3 but has eluded identification. We have used haplotype analysis of linkage disequilibrium to spotlight a small segment of 4p16.3 as the likely location of the defect. A new gene, 1715, isolated using cloned trapped exons from the target area contains a polymorphic trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on HD chromosomes. A (CAG)n repeat longer than the normal range was observed on HD chromosomes from all 75 disease families examined, comprising a variety of ethnic backgrounds and 4p 16.3 haplotypes. The (CAG)n repeat appears to be located within the coding sequence of a predicted ≈348 kd protein that is widely expressed but unrelated to any known gene. Thus, the HD mutation involves an unstable DNA segment, similar to those described in fragile X syndrome, spino-bulbar muscular atrophy, and myotonic dystrophy, acting in the context of a novel 4p16.3 gene to produce a dominant phenotype.}

This mean, known as the Wasserstein barycenter&nbsp;(Agueh and Carlier, 2011; Rabin et al, 2012), is the measure that minimizes the sum of its Wasserstein distances to each element in that set. We argue through a simple example that Wasserstein barycenters have appealing properties that differentiate them from other barycenters proposed recently, which all build on kernel smoothing and/or Bregman divergences. Two original algorithms are proposed that require the repeated computation of primal and dual optimal solutions of transport problems. However direct implementation of these algorithms is too costly as optimal transports are notoriously computationally expensive. Extending the work of Cuturi (2013), we smooth both the primal and dual of the optimal transport problem to recover fast approximations of the primal and dual optimal solutions. We apply these algorithms to the visualization of perturbed images and to a clustering problem.}

  optabstract = 	 {The ability to compare two degenerate probability distributions, that is two distributions supported on low-dimensional manifolds in much higher-dimensional spaces, is a crucial factor in the estimation of generative mod- els.It is therefore no surprise that optimal transport (OT) metrics and their ability to handle measures with non-overlapping sup- ports have emerged as a promising tool. Yet, training generative machines using OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i) the computational bur- den of evaluating OT losses, (ii) their instability and lack of smoothness, (iii) the difficulty to estimate them, as well as their gradients, in high dimension. This paper presents the first tractable method to train large scale generative models using an OT-based loss called Sinkhorn loss which tackles these three issues by relying on two key ideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into a differentiable and more robust quantity that can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic (automatic) differentiation of these iterations with seam- less GPU execution. Additionally, Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses interpolating between Wasserstein (OT) and Energy distance/Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) losses, thus allowing to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT on the one hand, and the favorable high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD, which comes with un- biased gradient estimates. The resulting computational architecture complements nicely standard deep network generative models by a stack of extra layers implementing the loss function.}

Simple norms and divergences such as the total variation and the relative entropy only compare densities in a point-wise manner and fail to capture the geometric nature of the problem. In sharp contrast, Maximum Mean Discrepancies (MMD) and Optimal Transport distances (OT) are two classes of distances between measures that take into account the geometry of the underlying space and metrize the convergence in law.  This paper studies the Sinkhorn divergences, a family of geometric divergences that interpolates between MMD and OT. Relying on a new notion of geometric entropy, we provide theoretical guarantees for these divergences: positivity, convexity and metrization of the convergence in law. On the practical side, we detail a numerical scheme that enables the large scale application of these divergences for machine learning: on the GPU, gradients of the Sinkhorn loss can be computed for batches of a million samples.}

The first performs exact projection in O(n) expected time, where n is the dimension of the space. The second works on vectors k of whose elements are perturbed outside the l1-ball, projecting in O(k log(n)) time. This setting is especially useful for online learning in sparse feature spaces such as text categorization applications. We demonstrate the merits and effectiveness of our algorithms in numerous batch and online learning tasks. We show that variants of stochastic gradient projection methods augmented with our efficient projection procedures outperform interior point methods, which are considered state-of-the-art optimization techniques. We also show that in online settings gradient updates with l1 projections outperform the exponentiated gradient algorithm while obtaining models with high degrees of sparsity.},

In silico analysis of datasets, representing only one RNA species is well established and a variety of tools and pipelines are available. However, attaining a more systematic view of how different players come together to regulate the expression of a gene or a group of genes requires a more intricate approach to data analysis. To fully understand complex transcriptional networks, datasets representing different RNA species need to be integrated. In this review, we will focus on miRNAs as key post-transcriptional regulators summarizing current computational approaches for miRNA:target gene prediction as well as new data-driven methods to tackle the problem of comprehensively and accurately dissecting miRNome-targetome interactions.}

                  type-specific gene expression changes  in human HD and mouse
                  models of HD. In striatal spiny projection neurons, the most

                  mitochondrial  RNA (mtRNA)  (a potent  mitochondrial-derived
                  innate immunogen)  and a concomitant upregulation  of innate
                  immune signaling  in spiny  projection neurons.  Further, we
                  observe that  the released mtRNAs  can directly bind  to the
                  innate immune  sensor protein  kinase R (PKR).  We highlight
                  the   importance  of   studying   cell  type-specific   gene

It has proven difficult to identify the early stages of disease and where it spreads within the 	body. Maniatis et al. used RNA sequencing to define transcriptomic changes over the course of disease in different 		regions of the spinal cord of a mouse ALS model and a postmortem human ALS spinal cord. From changes in gene 		expression, they identified disease-associated pathways and established the key steps in motor neuron degeneration 	observed in ALS.Science, this issue p. 89Paralysis occurring in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) results from 		denervation of skeletal muscle as a consequence of motor neuron degeneration. Interactions between motor neurons 	and glia contribute to motor neuron loss, but the spatiotemporal ordering of molecular events that drive these 			processes in intact spinal tissue remains poorly understood. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to obtain gene 		expression measurements of mouse spinal cords over the course of disease, as well as of postmortem tissue from 		ALS patients, to characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms in ALS. We identify pathway dynamics, 			distinguish regional differences between microglia and astrocyte populations at early time points, and discern 			perturbations in several transcriptional pathways shared between murine models of ALS and human postmortem 		spinal cords.},

Among the different approaches of block clustering, we consider here a model-based method: the Gaussian latent block model for continuous data which is an extension of the Gaussian mixture model for one-way clustering. For a given data table, several candidate models are usually examined, which differ for example in the number of clusters. Model selection then becomes a critical issue. To this end, we develop a criterion based on an approximation of the integrated classification likelihood for the Gaussian latent block model, and propose a Bayesian information criterion-like variant following the same pattern. We also propose a non-asymptotic exact criterion, thus circumventing the controversial definition of the asymptotic regime arising from the dual nature of the rows and columns in co-clustering. The experimental results show steady performances of these criteria for medium to large data tables.},

  OPTabstract = 	 {The ability to compare two degenerate probability distributions, that is two distributions supported on low-dimensional manifolds in much higher-dimensional spaces, is a crucial factor in the estimation of generative mod- els.It is therefore no surprise that optimal transport (OT) metrics and their ability to handle measures with non-overlapping sup- ports have emerged as a promising tool. Yet, training generative machines using OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i) the computational bur- den of evaluating OT losses, (ii) their instability and lack of smoothness, (iii) the difficulty to estimate them, as well as their gradients, in high dimension. This paper presents the first tractable method to train large scale generative models using an OT-based loss called Sinkhorn loss which tackles these three issues by relying on two key ideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into a differentiable and more robust quantity that can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic (automatic) differentiation of these iterations with seam- less GPU execution. Additionally, Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses interpolating between Wasserstein (OT) and Energy distance/Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) losses, thus allowing to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT on the one hand, and the favorable high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD, which comes with un- biased gradient estimates. The resulting computational architecture complements nicely standard deep network generative models by a stack of extra layers implementing the loss function.}

abstract = {Biclustering has become a popular technique for the study of gene expression data, especially for discovering functionally related gene sets under different subsets of experimental conditions. Most of biclustering approaches use a measure or cost function that determines the quality of biclusters. In such cases, the development of both a suitable heuristics and a good measure for guiding the search are essential for discovering interesting biclusters in an expression matrix. Nevertheless, not all existing biclustering approaches base their search on evaluation measures for biclusters. There exists a diverse set of biclustering tools that follow different strategies and algorithmic concepts which guide the search towards meaningful results. In this paper we present a extensive survey of biclustering approaches, classifying them into two categories according to whether or not use evaluation metrics within the search method: biclustering algorithms based on evaluation measures and non metric-based biclustering algorithms. In both cases, they have been classified according to the type of meta-heuristics which they are based on.}

Two algorithms have been developed: block EM as part of the maximum likelihood and fuzzy approaches, and block CEM as part of the classification maximum likelihood approach. A unified framework for obtaining different variants of block EM is proposed. These variants are studied and their performances evaluated in comparison with block CEM, two-way EM and two-way CEM, i.e EM and CEM applied separately to the two sets."

abstract = "In this paper we show how the modularity measure can serve as a useful criterion for co-clustering document-term matrices. We present and investigate the performance of CoClus, a novel, effective block-diagonal co-clustering algorithm which directly maximizes this modularity measure. The maximization is performed using an iterative alternating optimization procedure, in contrast to algorithms that use spectral relaxations of the discrete optimization problems. Extensive comparative experiments performed on various document-term datasets demonstrate that this approach is very effective, stable, and outperforms other block-diagonal co-clustering algorithms devoted to the same task. Another important advantage of using modularity in the co-clustering context is that it provides a novel, simple way of determining the appropriate number of co-clusters. Availability: an implementation of CoClus is available as part of the recently released coclust Python package which is available at: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coclust"

abstract = {Co-clustering is known to be a very powerful and efficient approach in unsupervised learning because of its ability to partition data based on both the observations and the variables of a given dataset. However, in high-dimensional context co-clustering methods may fail to provide a meaningful result due to the presence of noisy and/or irrelevant features. In this paper, we tackle this issue by proposing a novel co-clustering model which assumes the existence of a noise cluster, that contains all irrelevant features. A variational expectation-maximization-based algorithm is derived for this task, where the automatic variable selection as well as the joint clustering of objects and variables are achieved via a Bayesian framework. Experimental results on synthetic datasets show the efficiency of our model in the context of high-dimensional noisy data. Finally, we highlight the interest of the approach on two real datasets which goal is to study genetic diversity across the world.},
